# words-in-grid
./words_in_grid.out dict_file.txt

After initializing the program with a text file of words separated by whitespace (dict_file.txt), the user can then input a string of letters. The program will then print out all of the words in dict_file.txt that can be made with those letters. Documentation is in words_in_grid.cpp.
